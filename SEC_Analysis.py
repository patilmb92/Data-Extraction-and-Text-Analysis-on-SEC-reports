In the opinion of management, these financial\n  statements  contain all adjustments, consisting of normal  recurring\n  accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results\n  of  operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. Results  of\n  operations  for  the  periods presented herein are  not  necessarily\n  indicative  of  results  of operations for  the  entire  year.   The\n  condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts  of\n  AMR   Corporation  (AMR  or  the  Company)  and  its  wholly   owned\n  subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary American  Airlines,\n  Inc.  (American). For further information, refer to the consolidated\n  financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the AMR Annual\n  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 (2002 Form\n  10-K). Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2003\n  presentation.\n\n  The   Company\'s  Regional  Affiliates  include  two   wholly   owned\n  subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive  Airlines,\n  Inc.  (collectively, AMR Eagle), and two independent carriers, Trans\n  States  Airlines, Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua Airlines,  Inc.\n  (Chautauqua).  For the six months ended June 30, 2002, American  had\n  a  fee  per block hour agreement with Chautauqua and  revenue\n  prorate  agreements  with  AMR Eagle and  Trans  States.   Effective\n  January  1, 2003, American converted the AMR Eagle carriers  from  a\n  revenue  prorate agreement to a fee per block hour agreement.   This\n  change  does  not  have  any  impact on the  Company\'s  consolidated\n  financial  statements, but has changed the results of the  Company\'s\n  wholly  owned  subsidiaries on an individual  basis.   For  the  six\n  months  ended June 30, 2003, American also had fee  per  block\n  hour agreements with Trans States and Chautauqua.\n\n2.In  February  2003,  American  asked its  labor  leaders  and  other\n  employees  for approximately $1.8 billion in annual savings  through\n  a  combination  of changes in wages, benefits and work  rules.   The\n  requested  $1.8  billion in savings was divided  by  work  group  as\n  follows:   $660  million  -  pilots; $620 million  -  Transportation\n  Workers   Union  represented  employees;  $340  million   -   flight\n  attendants;  $100 million - management and support  staff;  and  $80\n  million  - agents and representatives.  References in this  document\n  to   American\'s  three  major  unions  include:  the  Allied  Pilots\n  Association (the APA); the Transportation Workers Union  (the  TWU);\n  and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (the APFA).\n\n  On   March  31,  2003,  American  announced  that  it  had   reached\n  agreements  with its three major unions (the Labor Agreements).   It\n  also reported various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-\n  unionized  personnel  including officers and other  management  (the\n  Management  Reductions).  The anticipated cost savings arising  from\n  the  Labor Agreements and the Management Reductions met the targeted\n  annual savings of $1.8 billion.\n\n  On  April  24,  2003  and  April 25, 2003, the  three  major  unions\n  certified  the  ratification  of  the  Labor  Agreements  with  some\n  modifications  (the  Modified  Labor  Agreements).   The   principal\n  modifications  were a shorter duration and the ability  to  initiate\n  the  process  of re-negotiating the Modified Labor Agreements  after\n  three  years.  Even  with these modifications,  the  Modified  Labor\n  Agreements continue to meet the targeted annual savings.\n\n  Of  the  approximately  $1.8  billion in estimated  annual  savings,\n  approximately  $1.0  billion relate to wage and  benefit  reductions\n  while  the  remaining approximately $.8 billion is  expected  to  be\n  accomplished  through changes in work rules, which  will  result  in\n  additional  job  reductions.  As a result of  these  additional  job\n  reductions,  the  Company incurred $60 million in severance  charges\n  in   the   second  quarter  of  2003  (see  Note  5  for  additional\n  information). Wage reductions became effective on April 1, 2003  for\n  officers  and  May  1,  2003  for all other  employees.   Reductions\n  related  to  benefits and work rule changes will be phased  in  over\n  time.  In  connection with the changes in wages, benefits  and  work\n  rules,  the Company granted approximately 38 million shares  of  AMR\n  stock  to  American\'s employees in the form of stock  options  which\n  will vest over a three year period with an exercise price of $5  per\n  share  (see Note 12 for additional information).\n\n                                 -4-\n\n 7\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n  In  addition,  subsequent to the ratification of the Modified  Labor\n  Agreements,   the   Company  and  American   reached   concessionary\n  agreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders (see Notes  9  and\n  13  for  additional  information) and suppliers  (collectively,  the\n  Vendors,  and  the  agreements, the Vendor Agreements).   Generally,\n  under  the terms of these Vendor Agreements the Company or  American\n  will  receive  the  benefit of lower rates and charges  for  certain\n  goods  and  services,  and more favorable rent and  financing  terms\n  with  respect  to  certain  of its aircraft.  In  return  for  these\n  concessions, the Company anticipates that it will issue - over  time\n  -  up to 3.0 million shares of AMR\'s common stock to Vendors.  As of\n  June 30, 2003, approximately 2.2 million shares have been issued  to\n  Vendors.\n\n  The  Company\'s  revenue environment has improved during  the  second\n  quarter of 2003 as reflected in improved unit revenues (revenue  per\n  available  seat  mile)  in  May  and  June  2003.  Even  with   this\n  improvement  however,  the Company\'s revenues  are  still  depressed\n  relative  to historical levels and the Company\'s recent losses  have\n  adversely  affected its financial condition. The  Company  therefore\n  needs  to  see  continued improvement in the revenue environment  to\n  return it to sustained profitability at acceptable levels.\n\n  To  maintain sufficient liquidity as the Company implements its plan\n  to   return  to  sustained  profitability,  the  Company  will  need\n  continued  access  to  additional funding,  most  likely  through  a\n  combination  of  financings  and  asset  sales.   In  addition,  the\n  Company\'s  ability to return to sustained profitability will  depend\n  on  a  number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond  the\n  Company\'s  control.  Among other things, the following factors  have\n  had  and/or may have a negative impact on the Company\'s business and\n  financial   results:    the   uncertain   financial   and   business\n  environment  the  Company faces, the struggling economy,  high  fuel\n  prices  and  the availability of fuel, the residual effects  of  the\n  war  in Iraq, conflicts in the Middle East, the residual effects  of\n  the  SARS  outbreak, historically low fare levels,  the  competitive\n  environment,   uncertainties   with   respect   to   the   Company\'s\n  international operations, changes in its business strategy,  actions\n  by  U.S. or foreign government agencies, the possible occurrence  of\n  additional  terrorist attacks, or the inability of  the  Company  to\n  satisfy  existing  liquidity  requirements  or  other  covenants  in\n  certain  of  its  credit arrangements (see Note  13  for  additional\n  information).   In   particular,   if   the   revenue    environment\n  deteriorates  beyond  normal seasonal  trends,  or  the  Company  is\n  unable  to  access  the capital markets or sell assets,  it  may  be\n  unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations.\n\n                                  -5-\n   8\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n3.The  Company  accounts  for its stock-based  compensation  plans  in\n  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion   No.   25,\n  "Accounting  for  Stock Issued to Employees" (APB  25)  and  related\n  Interpretations.    Under  APB  25,  no  compensation   expense   is\n  recognized  for  stock option grants if the exercise  price  of  the\n  Company\'s  stock option grants is at or above the fair market  value\n  of  the  underlying  stock on the date of grant.   The  Company  has\n  adopted  the pro forma disclosure features of Statement of Financial\n  Accounting   Standards   No.   123,  "Accounting   for   Stock-Based\n  Compensation"  (SFAS  123),  as amended by  Statement  of  Financial\n  Accounting   Standards   No.   148,  "Accounting   for   Stock-Based\n  Compensation-Transition  and  Disclosure".

The Act authorized  payment\n  of  (i) $100 million to compensate air carriers for the direct costs\n  associated  with  the strengthening of flight deck doors  and  locks\n  and  (ii)  $2.3  billion  to reimburse air  carriers  for  increased\n  security  costs which was distributed in proportion to  the  amounts\n  each  carrier  had paid or collected in passenger security  and  air\n  carrier  security fees to the Transportation Security Administration\n  as  of  the  Act\'s  enactment (the Security Fee Reimbursement).   In\n  addition, the Act suspends the collection of the passenger  security\n  fee  from  June  1,  2003 until October 1, 2003 and  authorizes  the\n  extension  of  war-risk  insurance  through  August  31,  2004  (and\n  permits  further extensions until December 31, 2004).  The Act  also\n  limits   the  total  cash  compensation  for  the  two  most  highly\n  compensated  named executive officers in 2002 for certain  airlines,\n  including the Company, during the period April 1, 2003 to  April  1,\n  2004  to  the amount of salary received by such officers,  or  their\n  successors,  in  2002.   A violation of this executive  compensation\n  provision would require the carrier to repay the government for  the\n  amount  of  the  Security Fee Reimbursement. The  Company  does  not\n  anticipate  any  difficulties in complying with this  limitation  on\n  executive  compensation and believes the likelihood of repaying  the\n  government  for  the  amount of the Security  Fee  Reimbursement  is\n  remote.  The  Company\'s Security Fee Reimbursement was $358  million\n  (net  of  payments  to  independent  regional  affiliates)  and  was\n  recorded  as  a  reduction to operating expenses during  the  second\n  quarter  of  2003.

In 2003, the Company recorded additional\n  Special charges and other charges as discussed below:\n\n  Aircraft Charges\n\n  In  the  second quarter of 2003, the Company determined that certain\n  accruals   for  future  lease  return  and  other  costs,  initially\n  recorded  as  a  component of Special charges  in  the  consolidated\n  statement  of  operations were no longer necessary.  In  the  second\n  quarter  of  2003, the Company recorded a $20 million  reduction  to\n  Special charges to finalize these accruals.\n\n  Employee Charges\n\n  In  the  first  quarter of 2003, as a part of its 2002 restructuring\n  initiatives,  the Company incurred $25 million in severance  charges\n  which  are included in Special charges in the consolidated statement\n  of operations.\n\n  The  Company estimates that it will reduce approximately 8,000  jobs\n  by  June 2004 in conjunction with the Management Reductions and  the\n  Modified  Labor  Agreements discussed in Note 2. This  reduction  in\n  workforce,  which  will  affect  all  work  groups  (pilots,  flight\n  attendants, mechanics, fleet service clerks, agents, management  and\n  support  staff  personnel),  has  been  and  will  continue  to   be\n  accomplished  through  various measures,  including  part-time  work\n  schedules,   furloughs  in  accordance  with  collective  bargaining\n  agreements,  and permanent layoffs.  As a result of  this  reduction\n  in  workforce,  during  the  second quarter  of  2003,  the  Company\n  recorded  an employee charge of approximately $60 million, primarily\n  for  severance related costs, which is included in Special  charges.\n  Cash  outlays for the $60 million employee charge will  be  incurred\n  over a period of up to twelve months.\n\n  Also  in  conjunction  with the Modified Labor  Agreements  and  the\n  Management  Reductions,  during the  second  quarter  of  2003,  the\n  Company  reduced its vacation accrual by $85 million to reflect  new\n  lower pay scales and maximum vacation caps, which was recorded as  a\n  reduction to Special charges.\n\n  In  connection  with  the  Modified Labor  Agreements,  the  Company\n  agreed to forgive a $26 million receivable from one its three  major\n  unions.  During the second quarter of 2003, the Company  recorded  a\n  $26 million Special charge to write-off the receivable.\n\n  In  addition,  as  discussed in Note 6,  the  Company  recognized  a\n  curtailment  loss  of  $46 million related to  its  defined  benefit\n  pension plans.\n\n  Facility Exit Costs\n\n  In  the  second quarter of 2003, the Company determined that certain\n  excess  airport space will not be used by the Company in the future.\n  As  a  result, the Company recorded a $45 million charge,  primarily\n  related to the fair value of future lease commitments and the write-\n  off  of certain prepaid rental amounts.  Cash outlays related to the\n  accrual  of  future lease commitments will occur over the  remaining\n  lease term, which extends through 2017.\n\n  Other\n\n  On  July  16,  2003, the Company announced that it will  reduce  the\n  size  of  its St. Louis hub, effective November 1, 2003,  and  close\n  its  St.  Louis reservations office, effective September  15,  2003.\n  As  a  result  of these actions, the Company expects to record  some\n  additional  charges  in  the  third and  fourth  quarters  of  2003.\n  Although the Company cannot estimate the amount of these charges  at\n  the  time  of  the  filing of this Form 10-Q, they are  expected  to\n  include  employee  severance  and benefits  charges,  facility  exit\n  costs and aircraft charges.\n\n                                    -7-\n\n 10\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n  Summary\n\n  The  following table summarizes the components of these charges  and\n  the  remaining  accruals for future lease payments,  aircraft  lease\n  return  and  other  costs,  facilities closure  costs  and  employee\n  severance and benefit costs (in millions):\n\n\n                            Aircraft  Facility  Employee\n                            Charges  Exit Costs  Charge    Total\n         \n     Remaining accrual at\n      December 31, 2002     $  209    $   17    $   44    $  270\n     Special charges             -         -        25        25\n     Payments                  (32)       (2)      (31)      (65)\n     Remaining accrual at\n      March 31, 2003           177        15        38       230\n     Special charges             -        49        47        96\n     Adjustments               (20)        -         -       (20)\n     Non-cash charges            -       (15)       22         7\n     Payments                  (12)        -       (42)      (54)\n     Remaining accrual at\n      June 30, 2003         $  145    $   49    $   65    $  259\n\n6.In the second quarter of 2003, as a result of the Modified Labor\n  Agreements and Management Reductions discussed in Note 2, the Company\n  remeasured  its  defined  benefit pension  plans.   The  significant\n  actuarial  assumptions used for the remeasurement were the  same  as\n  those used as of December 31, 2002 except for the discount rate  and\n  salary  scale, which were lowered to 6.50 percent, and 2.78  percent\n  through   2008  and  3.78  thereafter,  respectively.  In  addition,\n  assumptions with respect to interest rates used to discount lump sum\n  benefit  payments  available under certain plans  were  updated.  In\n  conjunction with the remeasurement, the Company recorded an increase\n  in its minimum pension liability, primarily due to changes in discount\n  rates, which resulted in an additional charge to stockholders\' equity\n  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  loss  of  $334  million.\n  Furthermore,  as  a result of workforce reductions  related  to  the\n  Modified  Labor  Agreements and Management Reductions,  the  Company\n  recognized a curtailment loss of $46 million related to its  defined\n  benefit  pension  plans, in accordance with Statement  of  Financial\n  Accounting  Standards No. 88, "Employers\' Accounting for Settlements\n  and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination\n  Benefits"  (SFAS 88), which is included in Special  charges  in  the\n  consolidated statement of operations.\n\n  The  following  table provides a statement of funded  status  as  of\n  April  22,  2003  and  December 31, 2002 for the  Company\'s  defined\n  benefit pension plans (in millions):\n\n\n\n                                               April 22,    December 31,\n                                                 2003         2002\n          \n        Funded status\n        Accumulated benefit obligation (ABO)   $7,800       $ 7,344\n        Projected benefit obligation (PBO)      8,345         8,757\n        Fair value of assets                    5,369         5,323\n\n        Funded status                          (2,976)       (3,434)\n         Unrecognized loss                      2,185         2,709\n         Unrecognized prior service cost          184           330\n         Unrecognized transition asset             (4)           (4)\n\n        Net amount recognized                   $(611)       $ (399)\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\n 11\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n7.The  Company has restricted cash and short-term investments  related\n  to  projected  workers\' compensation obligations and  various  other\n  obligations.  As  of June 30, 2003, projected workers\'  compensation\n  obligations   were  secured  by  restricted  cash   and   short-term\n  investments  of  $387  million and various  other  obligations  were\n  secured  by  restricted  cash  and short-term  investments  of  $163\n  million.  In  the first quarter of 2003, the Company  redeemed  $339\n  million  of tax-exempt bonds that were backed by standby letters  of\n  credit   secured  by  restricted  cash  and  short-term  investments\n  resulting   in  a  reduction  in  restricted  cash  and   short-term\n  investments.  Of  the  $339 million of tax-exempt  bonds  that  were\n  redeemed,  $253  million  were accounted for  as  operating  leases.\n  Payments  to redeem these tax-exempt special facility revenue  bonds\n  are  generally considered prepaid facility rentals and  will  reduce\n  future  operating lease commitments.  The remaining $86  million  of\n  tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as  debt  and\n  had original maturities in 2014 through 2024.\n\n  As  of  June 30, 2003 the Company had approximately $221 million  in\n  fuel  prepayments  and credit card holdback deposits  classified  as\n  Other  current assets and Other assets in the condensed consolidated\n  balance sheet.\n\n  In  June  2003,  the  Company  sold its  interest  in  Worldspan,  a\n  computer  reservations company, for $180 million in cash and  a  $39\n  million  promissory note, resulting in a gain of $17  million  which\n  is  included in Other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of\n  operations.\n\n8.As  of  June  30, 2003, the Company had commitments to  acquire  the\n  following aircraft: two Boeing 767-300ERs, 12 Embraer regional  jets\n  and  seven  Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2003; an aggregate of 74  Embraer\n  regional jets and six Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2004 through 2006;  and\n  an  aggregate  of 47 Boeing 737-800s and nine Boeing  777-200ERs  in\n  2006 through 2010.  Future payments for all aircraft, including  the\n  estimated  amounts  for  price  escalation,  will  approximate  $407\n  million  during the remainder of 2003, $755 million  in  2004,  $711\n  million  in  2005 and an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion  in\n  2006  through 2010. Boeing Capital Corporation has agreed to provide\n  backstop  financing for all Boeing aircraft deliveries in 2003.   In\n  return,  American has granted Boeing a security interest in  certain\n  advance  payments  previously made and in certain rights  under  the\n  aircraft  purchase  agreement  between  American  and  Boeing.    In\n  addition,  the  Company  has  pre-arranged  financing  or   backstop\n  financing  for  all  of  its 2003 Embraer  and  Bombardier  aircraft\n  deliveries and a portion of its post 2003 deliveries.\n\n  As  discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\n  included  in  the  Company\'s 2002 Form 10-K, Miami-Dade  County  is\n  currently   investigating  and  remediating  various  environmental\n  conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the\n  remediation  costs through landing fees and various  cost  recovery\n  methods.   American  and AMR Eagle have been named  as  potentially\n  responsible  parties (PRPs) for the contamination at  MIA.   During\n  the  second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against  17\n  defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover  its  past\n  and  future  cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida  v.  Advance\n  Cargo  Services,  Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit  Court).   In\n  addition  to  the  17  defendants named in the lawsuit,  243  other\n  agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and contributors  to\n  the  contamination.   American\'s and AMR  Eagle\'s  portion  of  the\n  cleanup  costs  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  due  to  various\n  factors, including the unknown extent of the remedial actions  that\n  may be required, the proportion of the cost that will ultimately be\n  recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding\n  the  environmental  agencies  that will  ultimately  supervise  the\n  remedial  activities  and  the  nature  of  that  supervision.   In\n  addition, the Company is subject to environmental issues at various\n  other  airport and non-airport locations for which it  has  accrued\n  $87   million  at  June  30,  2003.   Management  believes,   after\n  considering  a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition  of\n  these environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the\n  Company\'s consolidated financial position, results of operations or\n  cash flows.  Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on\n  the  Company\'s  current  assessments of the ultimate  outcome  and,\n  accordingly,  could  increase  or  decrease  as  these  assessments\n  change.\n\n                                  -9-\n\n 12\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n9.As   discussed   in  Note  2,  the  Company  reached  concessionary\n  agreements with certain lessors.  The Vendor Agreements with  these\n  lessors affected the payments, lease term, and other conditions  of\n  certain  leases.  As a result of these changes to the  payment  and\n  lease  terms,  30  leases which were previously  accounted  for  as\n  operating  leases were converted to capital leases, and  one  lease\n  which was previously accounted for as a capital lease was converted\n  to  an  operating lease.  The remaining leases did not change  from\n  their  original  classification.   The  Company  recorded  the  new\n  capital  leases  at the fair value of the respective  assets  being\n  leased.  These  changes did not have a significant  effect  on  the\n  Company\'s condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n\n  In  addition, certain of the concessionary agreements provide  that\n  the  Company\'s  obligations under the related lease revert  to  the\n  original terms if certain events occur prior to December 31,  2005,\n  including:  (i) an event of default under the related lease  (which\n  generally occurs only if a payment default occurs), (ii)  an  event\n  of  loss  with respect to the related aircraft, (iii) rejection  by\n  the  Company of the lease under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the\n  U.S.  Bankruptcy Code or (iv) the Company\'s filing  for  bankruptcy\n  under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  If any one of these events\n  were  to  occur, the Company would be responsible for approximately\n  $11 million in additional lease payments as of June 30, 2003.  This\n  amount will increase to $230 million prior to the expiration of the\n  provision on December 31, 2005.  Such amounts are being treated  as\n  contingent rentals and will only be recognized if they become due.\n\n  The  future  minimum lease payments required under  capital  leases,\n  together  with  the  present  value of  such  payments,  and  future\n  minimum  lease  payments required under operating leases  that  have\n  initial  or  remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess  of  one\n  year  as  of  June  30, 2003 were as follows (these amounts  reflect\n  concessions as a result of the Vendor Agreements):\n\n\n                                          Capital      Operating\n   Year Ending December 31,               Leases         Leases\n\n     \n   2003 (as of June 30, 2003)               $  107      $   715\n   2004                                        321        1,093\n   2005                                        252        1,035\n   2006                                        252          970\n   2007                                        187          947\n   2008 and subsequent                       1,321        9,330\n\n                                             2,440      $14,090 (1)\n\n   Less amount representing interest           988\n\n   Obligations under capital leases         $1,452\n  \n  (1)  As of June 30, 2003, included in Accrued liabilities\n  and  Other  liabilities and deferred credits on the  accompanying\n  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheets  is  approximately  $1.3\n  billion  relating to rent expense being recorded  in  advance  of\n  future operating lease payments.\n\n  At  June 30, 2003, the Company had 261 jet aircraft and 30 turboprop\n  aircraft  under  operating  leases  and  99  jet  aircraft  and   55\n  turboprop  aircraft  under  capital leases  -  which  includes  both\n  operating  and  non-operating aircraft.   The  aircraft  leases  can\n  generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the  end\n  of  the lease term for one to five years.  Some aircraft leases have\n  purchase  options  at  or near the end of the  lease  term  at  fair\n  market  value,  but generally not to exceed a stated  percentage  of\n  the  defined  lessor\'s cost of the aircraft or  at  a  predetermined\n  fixed amount.\n\n                                 -10-\n\n 13\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n10.Accumulated  depreciation of owned equipment and property  at  June\n  30,  2003  and December 31, 2002 was $8.8 billion and $8.4  billion,\n  respectively.   Accumulated amortization of equipment  and  property\n  under  capital  leases at June 30, 2003 and December  31,  2002  was\n  $1.0 billion and $974 million, respectively.\n\n11.The Company has experienced significant cumulative losses and as\n  a  result generated certain net operating losses available to offset\n  future taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,\n  a valuation allowance was established against the full amount of the\n  Company\'s net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company\n  provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more\n  likely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets\n  will not be realized.  During 2003, the Company continued to record a\n  valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results\n  in no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses and the charge\n  to  Accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the  minimum\n  pension  liability  adjustment discussed in Note  6.  The  Company\'s\n  deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased $533 million in 2003,\n  to $903 million as of June 30, 2003.\n\n12.In  March  2003,  the Board of Directors of AMR  approved  the\n  issuance  of additional shares of AMR common stock to employees  and\n  Vendors   in   connection   with  ongoing  negotiations   concerning\n  concessions.  The maximum number of shares authorized  for  issuance\n  was  30  percent  of  the number of shares of the  Company\'s  common\n  stock  outstanding on March 24, 2003 (156,359,955) or  approximately\n  46.9  million shares. From the foregoing authorization, the  Company\n  expects  to issue up to 3.0 million shares to Vendors.  As  of  June\n  30,  2003,  approximately 2.2 million shares  have  been  issued  to\n  Vendors,  from treasury stock, at an average price of $4.81  on  the\n  date  of  grant resulting in a re-allocation from Treasury stock  to\n  Additional  paid-in capital of $128 million.  Also  in  March  2003,\n  the   AMR  Board  of  Directors  adopted  the  2003  Employee  Stock\n  Incentive Plan (2003 Plan) to provide equity awards to employees  in\n  connection with wage, benefit and work rule concessions.  Under  the\n  2003  Plan,  all  American employees are eligible to  receive  stock\n  awards  which  may  include  stock  options,  restricted  stock  and\n  deferred   stock.   In  April  2003,  the  Company   reached   final\n  agreements  with  the  unions representing American  employees  (the\n  Modified  Labor  Agreements, see Note 2).  In  connection  with  the\n  changes  in  wages,  benefits and work  rules,  the  Modified  Labor\n  Agreements provide for the issuance of up to 37.9 million shares  of\n  AMR  stock in the form of stock options. Approximately 37.9  million\n  stock  options  were granted to employees at an  exercise  price  of\n  $5.00  per  share,  which  is equal to the closing  price  of  AMR\'s\n  common stock (NYSE) on April 17, 2003.  These shares will vest  over\n  a  three-year  period  and  will expire on  April  17,  2013.  These\n  options  were  granted to members of the APA,  the  TWU,  the  APFA,\n  agents,   other  non-management  personnel  and  certain  management\n  employees.\n\n13.During the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, American  and\n  AMR  Eagle  borrowed approximately $641 million under  various  debt\n  agreements  which  are secured by aircraft.  These  agreements  have\n  effective  interest  rates  which are fixed  or  variable  based  on\n  London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread and mature  over\n  various  periods  of time through 2019.  As of June  30,  2003,  the\n  effective  interest  rate  on these agreements  ranged  up  to  8.81\n  percent.\n\n  In  July  2003,  American issued $255 million of enhanced  equipment\n  trust  certificates,  secured by aircraft, which  bear  interest  at\n  3.86   percent   and  are  repayable  in  semi-annual   installments\n  beginning   in  2004,  with  a  final  maturity  in   2010.

In return,  the  lender  has  agreed  to\n  restructure  approximately $130 million in debt related  to  certain\n  of  these  aircraft.  In addition, American will provide  shares  of\n  AMR  common stock to the lender as discussed in Note 2. However, the\n  restructured debt agreement contains certain provisions  that  would\n  require  American to repay certain amounts of the original  debt  if\n  certain events occur prior to December 31, 2005, including:  (i)  an\n  event  of default (which generally occurs only if a payment  default\n  occurs),  (ii)  an  event  of  loss  with  respect  to  the  related\n  aircraft,  (iii)  rejection by the Company of the  lease  under  the\n  provisions  of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code  or  (iv)  the\n  Company\'s  filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of  the  Bankruptcy\n  Code.  The  Company  expects to recognize a significant  gain  as  a\n  result  of  this  restructuring,  with  the  majority  of  the  gain\n  recognized  in  the  third  quarter  of  2003,  and  the   remainder\n  recognized  on December 31, 2005, if none of the above  events  have\n  occurred.\n\n  American  has  a  fully  drawn  $834 million  credit  facility  that\n  expires  December 15, 2005.  On March 31, 2003, American and certain\n  lenders  in  such facility entered into a waiver and amendment  that\n  (i)  waived,  until  May  15,  2003, the requirement  that  American\n  pledge  additional  collateral  to  the  extent  the  value  of  the\n  existing  collateral  was  insufficient  under  the  terms  of   the\n  facility, (ii) waived American\'s liquidity covenant for the  quarter\n  ended  March  31,  2003,  (iii)  modified  the  financial  covenants\n  applicable  to subsequent periods, and (iv) increased the applicable\n  margin  for advances under the facility.  On May 15, 2003,  American\n  pledged  an  additional  30  (non-Section  1110  eligible)  aircraft\n  having  an  aggregate  net  book value  as  of  April  30,  2003  of\n  approximately  $450  million.  Pursuant to  the  modified  financial\n  covenants,  American is required to maintain at least  $1.0  billion\n  of   liquidity,  consisting  of  unencumbered  cash  and  short-term\n  investments,  for  the second quarter 2003 and  beyond.   While  the\n  Company  was  in compliance with the covenant at June 30,  2003,  if\n  the  Company is adversely affected by the risk factors discussed  in\n  Note  2  or  elsewhere in this Report, it is uncertain  whether  the\n  Company  will be able to satisfy this liquidity requirement  through\n  the expiration of the facility at the end of 2005. Failure to do  so\n  or  obtain  a waiver of this requirement would result in  a  default\n  under  this  facility  and  would likely trigger  defaults  under  a\n  significant number of other debt arrangements.\n\n  In  addition,  the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges  under\n  the  facility  has been decreased until the period  ending  December\n  31,  2004,  and the next test of such cash flow coverage ratio  will\n  not  occur until March 31, 2004.  The amendment also provided for  a\n  50  basis point increase in the applicable margin over LIBOR,  which\n  resulted  in  an effective interest rate (as of June  30,  2003)  of\n  4.73  percent.  The interest rate will be reset again  on  September\n  17,  2003.   At American\'s option, interest on the facility  can  be\n  calculated  on one of several different bases.  For most borrowings,\n  American  would  anticipate  choosing a  floating  rate  based  upon\n  LIBOR.\n\n  As   of   June   30,  2003,  AMR  has  issued  guarantees   covering\n  approximately  $935 million of American\'s tax-exempt bond  debt  and\n  American  has issued guarantees covering approximately $636  million\n  of  AMR\'s unsecured debt.  In addition, as of June 30, 2003, AMR and\n  American have issued guarantees covering approximately $521  million\n  of  AMR Eagle\'s secured debt, and AMR has issued guarantees covering\n  an additional $176 million of AMR Eagle\'s secured debt.\n\n                               -12-\n\n 15\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n14.Financial  Accounting Standards Board Interpretation  No.  46,\n  "Consolidation  of Variable Interest Entities" (Interpretation  46),\n  requires  the primary beneficiary of a variable interest  entity  to\n  include  the  assets, liabilities, and results of the activities  of\n  the   variable   interest  entity  in  its  consolidated   financial\n  statements,  as well as disclosure of information about  the  assets\n  and   liabilities,  and  the  nature,  purpose  and  activities   of\n  consolidated    variable    interest    entities.    In    addition,\n  Interpretation  46  requires disclosure  of  information  about  the\n  nature,  purpose and activities of unconsolidated variable  interest\n  entities   in  which  the  Company  holds  a  significant   variable\n  interest.    The  provisions  of  Interpretation  46  are  effective\n  immediately   for  any  interests  in  variable  interest   entities\n  acquired  after  January  31, 2003 and effective  beginning  in  the\n  third  quarter  of 2003 for all variable interests  acquired  before\n  February  1,  2003. Special facility revenue bonds have been  issued\n  by  certain  municipalities  primarily  to  purchase  equipment  and\n  improve   airport  facilities  that  are  leased  by  American   and\n  accounted  for as operating leases.  Approximately $2.1  billion  of\n  these  bonds  (with  total  future payments  of  approximately  $5.2\n  billion  as  of June 30, 2003) are guaranteed by American,  AMR,  or\n  both.  The  Company  is  currently evaluating the  applicability  of\n  Interpretation  46  to  these  airport lease  arrangements,  certain\n  aircraft  lease arrangement and other arrangements, and the possible\n  impact  on  its  future  consolidated  results  of  operations   and\n  consolidated balance sheet.\n\n  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  Interpretation   No.   45,\n  "Guarantor\'s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for  Guarantees,\n  Including   Indirect   Guarantees   of   Indebtedness   of   Others"\n  (Interpretation  45),  requires disclosures in  interim  and  annual\n  financial  statements  about obligations  under  certain  guarantees\n  issued  by the Company. Furthermore, it requires recognition at  the\n  beginning  of a guarantee of a liability for the fair value  of  the\n  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  the  guarantee,  with   limited\n  exceptions  including:  1) a parent\'s guarantee  of  a  subsidiary\'s\n  debt  to a third party, and 2) a subsidiary\'s guarantee of the  debt\n  owed to a third party by either its parent or another subsidiary  of\n  that  parent.  The  disclosure requirements are effective  for  this\n  filing  and  have  been  included  in  Notes  6,  7  and  8  to  the\n  consolidated  financial  statements  in  the  2002  Form  10-K.  The\n  initial  recognition  and initial measurement  provisions  are  only\n  applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or  modified\n  after  December 31, 2002.  This interpretation has had no impact  on\n  the  Company\'s  consolidated statement of  operations  or  condensed\n  consolidated balance sheets.\n\n15.Effective  January 1, 2002, the Company adopted  Statement  of\n  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  142,  "Goodwill  and   Other\n  Intangible  Assets" (SFAS 142).  SFAS 142 requires  the  Company  to\n  test  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible  assets  (for  AMR,\n  route  acquisition costs) for impairment rather than amortize  them.\n  In  2002,  the  Company completed an impairment analysis  for  route\n  acquisition costs in accordance with SFAS 142. The analysis did  not\n  result  in an impairment charge.  In addition, the Company completed\n  an  impairment analysis related to its $1.4 billion of goodwill  and\n  determined  the Company\'s entire goodwill balance was impaired.   In\n  arriving  at  this  conclusion, the Company\'s  net  book  value  was\n  determined  to be in excess of the Company\'s fair value  at  January\n  1,  2002,  using AMR as the reporting unit for purposes of the  fair\n  value  determination. The Company determined its fair  value  as  of\n  January   1,   2002  using  various  valuation  methods,  ultimately\n  utilizing  market  capitalization as the primary indicator  of  fair\n  value.   As  a  result,  the Company recorded a  one-time,  non-cash\n  charge,  effective  January  1, 2002, of  $988  million  ($6.37  per\n  share,  net  of a tax benefit of $363 million) to write-off  all  of\n  AMR\'s  goodwill.   This charge is nonoperational in  nature  and  is\n  reflected  as  a  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change  in  the\n  consolidated statements of operations.\n\n16.The  Company includes changes in minimum pension  liabilities,\n  changes   in   the  fair  value  of  certain  derivative   financial\n  instruments  that qualify for hedge accounting and unrealized  gains\n  and  losses on available-for-sale securities in comprehensive  loss.\n  For  the  three  months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002,  comprehensive\n  loss  was  $(417)  million  and $(496)  million,  respectively.   In\n  addition,  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2003  and  2002,\n  comprehensive  loss  was  $(1,480)  million  and  $(1,984)  million,\n  respectively.   The  difference between net loss  and  comprehensive\n  loss  is  due  primarily to the adjustment to the Company\'s  minimum\n  pension  liability, as discussed in Note 6, and the  accounting  for\n  the  Company\'s derivative financial instruments under  Statement  of\n  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for  Derivative\n  Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended (SFAS 133).\n\n                               -13-\n\n 16\nAMR CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n(Unaudited)\n\n  American  enters  into jet fuel, heating oil  and  crude  swap  and\n  option  contracts to protect against increases in jet fuel  prices.\n  Beginning  in March 2003, the Company revised its hedging  strategy\n  and,  in  June 2003, terminated substantially all of its  contracts\n  with  maturities beyond March 2004.  During the second  quarter  of\n  2003, the termination of these contracts resulted in the collection\n  of  approximately $41 million in settlement of the contracts.   The\n  gain on these contracts will continue to be deferred in Accumulated\n  other comprehensive loss until the time the original underlying jet\n  fuel hedged is used.\n\n  At  June 30, 2003, American had fuel hedging agreements with broker-\n  dealers  on  approximately  725 million gallons  of  fuel  products,\n  which  represented  approximately 29 percent of  its  expected  fuel\n  needs  for  the remainder of 2003, approximately 21 percent  of  its\n  expected   first  quarter  2004  fuel  needs  and  an  insignificant\n  percentage  of its expected fuel needs beyond the first  quarter  of\n  2004.   The  fair value of the Company\'s fuel hedging agreements  at\n  June 30, 2003, representing the amount the Company would receive  to\n  terminate  the  agreements, totaled $115 million, compared  to  $212\n  million  at  December  31, 2002, and is included  in  Other  current\n  assets.\n\n17.The  following table sets forth the computations of basic  and\n  diluted  loss  per  share  before cumulative  effect  of  accounting\n  change (in millions, except per share data):\n\n\n                                      Three Months Ended    Six Months Ended\n                                           June 30,              June 30,\n                                       2003       2002       2003       2002\n       \n  Numerator:\n  Net loss before cumulative effect of\n   accounting change - numerator for\n   basic and diluted loss per share   $(75)     $(495)      $(1,118)   $(1,070)\n\n  Denominator:\n  Denominator  for basic and  diluted\n   loss  per  share before cumulative\n   effect  of  accounting  change   -\n   weighted-average shares              158       155           157        155\n\n  Basic and diluted loss per share\n   before cumulative effect of\n   accounting change                  $(.47)   $(3.19)       $(7.11)    $(6.90)\n\n  For  the three and six months ended June 30, 2003 approximately nine\n  million  and  five million potential dilutive shares,  respectively,\n  were  not added to the denominator, because inclusion of such shares\n  would  be  antidilutive, as compared to approximately  five  million\n  and  seven  million  shares, respectively, for  the  three  and  six\n  months ended June 30, 2002.\n\n                                  -14-\n\n 17\nItem  2.   Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nFor the Three Months Ended June 30, 2003 and 2002\n\nSummary  AMR  Corporation\'s (AMR or the Company) net loss  during  the\nsecond quarter of 2003 was $75 million, or $.47 per share, as compared\nto  a net loss of $495 million, or $3.19 per share for the same period\nin  2002.  AMR\'s  operating  earnings of $87  million  increased  $688\nmillion  compared  to the same period in 2002.  The  Company\'s  second\nquarter   2003   results  include  $358  million  in   security   cost\nreimbursements  received  under  the  Emergency  Wartime  Supplemental\nAppropriations  Act,  2003 (the Act) (see  Note  4  to  the  condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for additional information).   AMR\'s\nprincipal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American).\n\nThe Company\'s second quarter 2003 revenues continued to decrease year-\nover-year,  but  at a slower rate than its capacity.   In  April,  the\nCompany\'s revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the economic\nslowdown, the war in Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome  (SARS).  In May and June however, these trends reversed  and\nwhile  capacity  was  down  year-over-year, the  Company  showed  unit\nrevenue  (passenger  revenue  per available  seat  mile)  improvement.\nOverall,  the Company\'s revenues decreased approximately $184 million,\nor 4.1 percent, to $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2003 from the\nsame period last year.  American\'s passenger revenues decreased by 5.4\npercent, or $203 million, in the second quarter of 2003 as compared to\nthe same period in 2002.  American\'s second quarter domestic passenger\nrevenue per available seat mile (RASM) however, increased 4.0 percent,\nto  8.81 cents, on a capacity decrease of 9.6 percent, to 29.0 billion\navailable  seat  miles (ASMs).  International RASM decreased  to  8.57\ncents,  or  1.2 percent, on a capacity decrease of 2.7  percent.   The\ndecrease  in  international RASM was due to a  20.3  percent  and  1.8\npercent  decrease  in  Pacific and Latin American RASM,  respectively,\nslightly  offset  by  a 2.4 percent increase in  European  RASM.   The\ndecrease  in  international capacity was driven by a 9.5 percent,  2.4\npercent  and  1.8  percent reduction in Pacific,  European  and  Latin\nAmerican ASMs, respectively.\n\nThe   Company\'s   Regional  Affiliates  include   two   wholly   owned\nsubsidiaries,  American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and  Executive  Airlines,\nInc.  (collectively, AMR Eagle), and two independent  carriers,  Trans\nStates  Airlines,  Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua  Airlines,  Inc.\n(Chautauqua).   In  2002,  American had a fee  per  block  hour\nagreement  with Chautauqua, and prorate agreements with AMR Eagle  and\nTrans  States.   In  2003,  American had  fee  per  block  hour\nagreements  with  all  three  carriers. Regional  Affiliates\'  traffic\nincreased  18.0  percent  while capacity increased  20.1  percent,  to\napproximately 2.1 billion ASMs. Certain amounts from 2002  related  to\nRegional  Affiliates have been reclassified to conform with  the  2003\npresentation.\n\nThe  Company\'s  operating expenses decreased  17.1  percent,  or  $872\nmillion.  Wages, salaries and benefits decreased 12.1 percent, or $257\nmillion, primarily due to the Modified Labor Agreements and Management\nReductions discussed in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.   Commissions,  booking  fees  and  credit  card   expense\ndecreased  16.4 percent, or $51 million, due primarily to the  benefit\nfrom the changes in the commission structure implemented in March 2002\nand  a  4.6  percent  decrease  in  passenger  revenues.  Maintenance,\nmaterials  and  repairs decreased 34.4 percent, or  $98  million,  due\nprimarily  to  a  decrease  in airframe  and  engine  volumes  at  the\nCompany\'s  maintenance  bases resulting  from  a  variety  of  factors\nincluding the retirement of aircraft, the timing of sending engines to\nrepair  vendors  and  a  decrease in the number  of  flights;  reduced\naircraft  utilization; and the receipt of certain vendor credits.  The\nCompany  expects maintenance, materials and repairs costs to  increase\nas  aircraft  utilization  increases and  the  benefit  from  retiring\naircraft  subsides.  Aircraft rentals decreased $37 million,  or  17.3\npercent,  due  primarily  to  concessionary  agreements  with  certain\nlessors  and  the  removal of leased aircraft from  service  in  prior\nperiods.   Food  service decreased 16.1 percent, or $29  million,  due\nprimarily to reductions in the level of food service.  Other operating\nexpenses decreased 15.4 percent, or $107 million, due to decreases  in\ncontract  maintenance work that American performs for other  airlines,\nand   decreases  in  travel  and  incidental  costs,  advertising  and\npromotion  costs,  insurance, and data processing  expenses.   Special\ncharges  for  the  second quarter of 2003 include (i)  a  $20  million\naircraft  related credit to finalize prior accruals, (ii) $49  million\nin facility exit costs and (iii) $47 million in employee charges.  See\nNote  5  to  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements   for\nadditional  information  regarding Special charges.   U.S.  government\ngrant includes a $358 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement\nof security service fees from the U.S. government under the Act.\n\n                               -15-\n\n 18\nOther  income  (expense), historically a net  expense,  increased  $43\nmillion  due to the following: Interest income decreased 55.6 percent,\nor  $10  million,  due  primarily to decreasing short-term  investment\nbalances  and decreases in interest rates.  Interest expense increased\n$26 million, or 15.9 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in\nthe Company\'s long-term debt.\n\nThe  Company has experienced significant cumulative losses  and  as  a\nresult  generated  certain net operating losses  available  to  offset\nfuture taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,\na  valuation allowance was established against the full amount of  the\nCompany\'s net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company\nprovides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more\nlikely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred  tax  assets\nwill not be realized.  During 2003, the Company continued to record  a\nvaluation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results\nin  no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses and the charge\nto  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss resulting from  the  minimum\npension  liability  adjustment discussed in Note 6  to  the  condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.  The Company\'s deferred  tax  asset\nvaluation  allowance increased $150 million in the second  quarter  of\n2003, to $903 million as of June 30, 2003.\n\nThe  effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30,  2002  was\nimpacted  by  a  $30  million charge resulting  from  a  provision  in\nCongress\'  economic  stimulus  package that  changed  the  period  for\ncarrybacks  of net operating losses (NOLs).  This change  allowed  the\nCompany  to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather  than\ntwo years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly\nrecover  its NOLs.  The extended NOL carryback did however  result  in\nthe  displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.   These\ncredits  are  now  expected to expire before  being  utilized  by  the\nCompany, resulting in this charge.\n\n\nOPERATING STATISTICS\n                                                    Three Months Ended June 30,\n                                                        2003          2002\n  \nAmerican Airlines, Inc.

The Company\'s 2003 results include $358  million\nin  security cost reimbursements received under the Act (see Note 4 to\nthe   condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for   additional\ninformation).  The Company\'s 2002 results include a one-time, non-cash\ncharge  to  record  the cumulative effect of a change  in  accounting,\neffective  January 1, 2002, of $988 million, or $6.37  per  share,  to\nwrite-off  all  of AMR\'s goodwill upon the adoption  of  Statement  of\nFinancial  Accounting  Standards Board No.  142  "Goodwill  and  Other\nIntangible   Assets"  (see  Note  15  to  the  condensed  consolidated\nfinancial statements).  AMR\'s operating loss of $782 million decreased\n$548 million compared to the same period in 2002.\n\nThe  Company\'s 2003 revenues continued to decrease year-over-year. The\nCompany\'s  revenues through April continued to be negatively  impacted\nby  the  economic slowdown, the war in Iraq and the outbreak of  SARS.\nThese trends however, began to reverse in May and June.  Overall,  the\nCompany\'s  revenues  decreased  approximately  $227  million,  or  2.6\npercent,  to  $8.4  billion  in 2003 from the  same  period  in  2002.\nAmerican\'s  passenger  revenues decreased  by  4.1  percent,  or  $293\nmillion,  in  2003 from the same period in 2002.  American\'s  domestic\nrevenue  per available seat mile (RASM) for the six months ended  June\n30,  however,  increased 0.4 percent, to 8.62  cents,  on  a  capacity\ndecrease of 5.9 percent, to 57.7 billion available seat miles  (ASMs).\nInternational  RASM  decreased to 8.50 cents, or  1.9  percent,  on  a\ncapacity increase of 1.7 percent.  The decrease in international  RASM\nwas  due  to  a 22.8 percent and 0.8 percent decrease in  Pacific  and\nLatin  American  RASM  slightly offset by a 1.4  percent  increase  in\nEuropean RASM.  The increase in international capacity was driven by a\n16.9  percent  and 3.0 percent increase in Pacific and European  ASMs,\nrespectively,  slightly  offset by a 1.7 percent  reduction  in  Latin\nAmerican ASMs.\n\nIn  2002,  American  had  a fixed fee per block  hour  agreement  with\nChautauqua,  and prorate agreements with AMR Eagle and  Trans  States.\nIn  2003,  American had fixed fee per block hour agreements  with  all\nthree  carriers.  Regional Affiliates\' traffic increased 16.1  percent\nin  2003  while capacity increased 17.5 percent, to approximately  4.1\nbillion ASMs. Certain amounts from 2002 related to Regional Affiliates\nhave been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation.\n\n                               -17-\n\n 20\nOther  revenues increased 11.4 percent, or $53 million, due  primarily\nto  increases  in  ticket  change fees coupled  with  changes  to  the\nCompany\'s  change fee arrangements with travel agencies, increases  in\nairfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges and increases\nin AAdvantage fees.\n\nThe  Company\'s  operating  expenses decreased  7.7  percent,  or  $775\nmillion.  Wages, salaries and benefits decreased 5.7 percent, or  $239\nmillion, primarily due to the Modified Labor Agreements and Management\nReductions discussed in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.  Aircraft  fuel expense increased 16.3  percent,  or  $193\nmillion,  due  primarily  to  a 23.8 percent  increase  in  American\'s\naverage price per gallon of fuel. Commissions, booking fees and credit\ncard expense decreased 18.4 percent, or $116 million, due primarily to\nthe  benefit  from the changes in the commission structure implemented\nin  March  2002  and  a  3.5 percent decrease in  passenger  revenues.\nMaintenance,  materials and repairs decreased 24.1  percent,  or  $133\nmillion, due primarily to a decrease in airframe and engine volumes at\nthe  Company\'s maintenance bases resulting from a variety  of  factors\nincluding the retirement of aircraft, the timing of sending engines to\nrepair  vendors  and  a  decrease in the number  of  flights;  reduced\naircraft  utilization; and the receipt of certain vendor credits.  The\nCompany  expects maintenance, materials and repairs costs to  increase\nas  aircraft  utilization  increases and  the  benefit  from  retiring\naircraft  subsides. Aircraft rentals decreased $73  million,  or  16.6\npercent,  due  primarily  to  concessionary  agreements  with  certain\nlessors  and  the  removal of leased aircraft from  service  in  prior\nperiods.   Food  service decreased 14.3 percent, or $50  million,  due\nprimarily to reductions in the level of food service. Special  charges\nfor  the  six  months ended June 30, 2003 include (i)  a  $20  million\naircraft  related credit to finalize prior accruals, (ii) $49  million\nin facility exit costs and (iii) $72 million in employee charges.  See\nNote  5  to  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements   for\nadditional  information  regarding Special charges.   U.S.  government\ngrant includes a $358 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement\nof security service fees from the U.S. government under the Act.\n\nOther  income  (expense), historically a net  expense,  increased  $83\nmillion  due to the following: Interest income decreased 41.7 percent,\nor  $15  million,  due  primarily to decreasing short-term  investment\nbalances and a decrease in interest rates.  Interest expense increased\n$52 million, or 15.8 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in\nthe  Company\'s long-term debt. Miscellaneous-net decreased $9 million,\ndue  to  the  write-down of certain investments held  by  the  Company\nduring the first quarter of 2003.\n\nThe  Company has experienced significant cumulative losses  and  as  a\nresult  generated  certain net operating losses  available  to  offset\nfuture taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,\na  valuation allowance was established against the full amount of  the\nCompany\'s net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company\nprovides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more\nlikely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred  tax  assets\nwill not be realized.  During 2003, the Company continued to record  a\nvaluation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results\nin  no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses and the charge\nto  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss resulting from  the  minimum\npension  liability  adjustment discussed in Note 6  to  the  condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.  The Company\'s deferred  tax  asset\nvaluation allowance increased $533 million in 2003, to $903 million as\nof June 30, 2003.\n\nThe  effective  tax rate for the six months ended June  30,  2002  was\nimpacted  by  a  $57  million charge resulting  from  a  provision  in\nCongress\'  economic  stimulus  package that  changed  the  period  for\ncarrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs).\n\n                                    -18-\n\n 21\n\n\nOPERATING STATISTICS\n                                                      Six Months Ended June 30,\n                                                          2003        2002\n  \nAmerican Airlines, Inc.

The  requested  $1.8\nbillion in savings was divided by work group as follows:  $660 million\n- -  pilots;  $620  million - Transportation Workers  Union  represented\nemployees; $340 million - flight attendants; $100 million - management\nand  support  staff;  and  $80 million - agents  and  representatives.\nReferences in this document to American\'s three major unions  include:\nthe  Allied  Pilots Association (the APA); the Transportation  Workers\nUnion (the TWU); and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants\n(the APFA).\n\nOn  March  31, 2003, American announced that it had reached agreements\nwith  its three major unions (the Labor Agreements).  It also reported\nvarious  changes  in  the  pay  plans and benefits  for  non-unionized\npersonnel  including  officers and other  management  (the  Management\nReductions).   The  anticipated cost savings arising  from  the  Labor\nAgreements  and  the  Management Reductions met  the  targeted  annual\nsavings of $1.8 billion.\n\nOn April 24, 2003 and April 25, 2003, the three major unions certified\nthe  ratification of the Labor Agreements with some modifications (the\nModified  Labor  Agreements).   The  principal  modifications  were  a\nshorter  duration  and  the ability to initiate  the  process  of  re-\nnegotiating the Modified Labor Agreements after three years. Even with\nthese  modifications, the Modified Labor Agreements continue  to  meet\nthe targeted annual savings.\n\n                                -19-\n\n 22\nOf  the  approximately  $1.8  billion  in  estimated  annual  savings,\napproximately $1.0 billion relate to wage and benefit reductions while\nthe remaining approximately $.8 billion is expected to be accomplished\nthrough  changes  in work rules, which will result in  additional  job\nreductions.   As  a  result of these additional  job  reductions,  the\nCompany  incurred  $60  million in severance  charges  in  the  second\nquarter  of  2003 (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated  financial\nstatements   for  additional  information).  Wage  reductions   became\neffective on April 1, 2003 for officers and May 1, 2003 for all  other\nemployees.  Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes  will\nbe  phased in over time. The Company expects total savings from wages,\nbenefits and work rule changes to be $400 million in the third quarter\nof 2003 and $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  In connection\nwith  the  changes  in  wages, benefits and work  rules,  the  Company\ngranted  approximately 38 million shares of AMR  stock  to  American\'s\nemployees  in the form of stock options which will vest over  a  three\nyear  period with an exercise price of $5 per share  (see Note  12  to\nthe   condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for   additional\ninformation).\n\nIn  addition,  subsequent to the ratification of  the  Modified  Labor\nAgreements, the Company and American reached concessionary  agreements\nwith  certain  vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers  (collectively,\nthe  Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements).   Generally,\nunder  the  terms of these Vendor Agreements the Company  or  American\nwill  receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods\nand services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect\nto  certain  of  its  aircraft. In return for these  concessions,  the\nCompany anticipates that it will issue - over time - up to 3.0 million\nshares  of  AMR\'s  common stock to Vendors.   As  of  June  30,  2003,\napproximately 2.2 million shares have been issued to Vendors.   As  of\nJune  30, 2003, the annual cost savings from the Vendors are estimated\nto be nearly $200 million.\n\nThe  Company\'s  revenue  environment has improved  during  the  second\nquarter  of  2003 as reflected in improved unit revenues (revenue  per\navailable  seat mile) in May and June 2003. Even with this improvement\nhowever,  the  Company\'s  revenues are  still  depressed  relative  to\nhistorical  levels  and  the Company\'s recent  losses  have  adversely\naffected its financial condition. The Company therefore needs  to  see\ncontinued  improvement  in the revenue environment  to  return  it  to\nsustained profitability at acceptable levels.\n\nTo maintain sufficient liquidity as the Company implements its plan to\nreturn  to  sustained profitability, the Company will  need  continued\naccess  to  additional funding, most likely through a  combination  of\nfinancings  and  asset sales.  In addition, the Company\'s  ability  to\nreturn  to  sustained profitability will depend on a  number  of  risk\nfactors,  many  of  which  are largely beyond the  Company\'s  control.\nAmong  other things, the following factors have had and/or may have  a\nnegative impact on the Company\'s business and financial results:   the\nuncertain  financial and business environment the Company  faces,  the\nstruggling economy, high fuel prices and the availability of fuel, the\nresidual effects of the war in Iraq, conflicts in the Middle East, the\nresidual  effects of the SARS outbreak, historically low fare  levels,\nthe   competitive  environment,  uncertainties  with  respect  to  the\nCompany\'s  international operations, changes in its business strategy,\nactions   by  U.S.  or  foreign  government  agencies,  the   possible\noccurrence  of additional terrorist attacks, or the inability  of  the\nCompany  to satisfy existing liquidity requirements or other covenants\nin  certain of its credit arrangements. In particular, if the  revenue\nenvironment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the Company\nis  unable  to access the capital markets or sell assets,  it  may  be\nunable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations.\n\nDuring 2001 and 2002, the Company raised approximately $8.3 billion of\nfunding  to finance capital commitments and to fund operating  losses.\nThe  Company expects that it will need continued access to the capital\nmarkets   until  such  time  as  the  Company  returns  to   sustained\nprofitability.   The  Company  had  approximately  $1.8   billion   in\nunrestricted cash and short-term investments as of June 30, 2003.  The\nCompany   also  had  available  possible  future  financing   sources,\nincluding,  but  not  limited to: (i) a limited amount  of  additional\nsecured  aircraft debt (after giving effect to the July 2003  enhanced\nequipment  trust  certificates transaction described below,  virtually\nall  of  the Company\'s Section 1110-eligible aircraft are encumbered),\n(ii) sale-leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft\nand  real  estate, (iii) securitization of future operating  receipts,\n(iv) unsecured debt, (v) equity and (vi) the potential sale of certain\nnon-core   assets   (including   the  Company\'s   interests   in   AMR\nInvestments).  However, the availability and level of these  financing\nsources cannot be assured, particularly in light of the fact that  the\nCompany  has fewer unencumbered assets available than it  had  in  the\npast.  To the extent that the Company\'s revenues deteriorate and it is\nunable  to  access capital markets and raise additional  capital,  the\nCompany  may  be  unable  to  fund its  obligations  and  sustain  its\noperations.\n\n                                 -20-\n\n 23\nIn July 2003, American issued $255 million of enhanced equipment trust\ncertificates, secured by aircraft, which bear interest at 3.86 percent\nand  are repayable in semi-annual installments beginning in 2004, with\na  final  maturity in 2010.  These obligations are insured by a  third\nparty.\n\nThe  Company has a significant amount of indebtedness which could have\nimportant consequences, such as (i) limiting the Company\'s ability  to\nobtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions  and  general  purposes, (ii) requiring  the  Company  to\ndedicate  a  substantial portion of its cash flow from  operations  to\npayments on its indebtedness, (iii) making the Company more vulnerable\nto  economic  downturns, limiting its ability to withstand competitive\npressures  and  reducing  its flexibility in  responding  to  changing\nbusiness  and  economic  conditions, and (iv) limiting  the  Company\'s\nflexibility  in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its  business\nand the industry in which it operates.\n\nAMR  and  American\'s credit ratings are significantly below investment\ngrade.  In February 2003, Moody\'s downgraded the senior implied rating\nfor AMR, the senior unsecured ratings of both AMR and American and the\nratings  of  most of American\'s secured debt. Also in  February  2003,\nStandard  & Poor\'s lowered its long-term corporate credit ratings  for\nboth  AMR and American, lowered the senior secured and unsecured  debt\nratings  of  AMR,  and  lowered the secured debt rating  of  American.\nAmerican\'s  short-term  rating  was withdrawn.   Ratings  on  most  of\nAmerican\'s  non-enhanced  equipment  trust  certificates   were   also\nlowered.   In March 2003, Standard & Poor\'s further lowered its  long-\nterm  corporate credit ratings for both AMR and American, lowered  the\nsenior  secured  and unsecured debt ratings of AMR,  and  lowered  the\nsecured  debt  rating of American. Ratings on most of American\'s  non-\nenhanced  equipment  trust  certificates  were  also  lowered.   These\nprevious  reductions have increased the Company\'s borrowing costs.  On\nJune  9,  2003,  Moody\'s affirmed the ratings  of  AMR  and  American,\nremoved  the ratings from review for possible downgrade, and gave  the\nratings  a  negative  outlook.  On June 20, 2003,  Standard  &  Poor\'s\nraised  its  ratings of AMR and American and removed the ratings  from\nCreditWatch. Additional significant reductions in AMR\'s or  American\'s\ncredit ratings would further increase its borrowing or other costs and\nfurther restrict the availability of future financing. In March  2003,\nStandard & Poor\'s removed AMR\'s common stock from the S&P 500 index.\n\nAmerican  has a fully drawn $834 million credit facility that  expires\nDecember 15, 2005.  On March 31, 2003, American and certain lenders in\nsuch  facility  entered into a waiver and amendment that  (i)  waived,\nuntil  May  15, 2003, the requirement that American pledge  additional\ncollateral  to  the  extent the value of the existing  collateral  was\ninsufficient  under the terms of the facility, (ii) waived  American\'s\nliquidity  covenant  for  the  quarter ended  March  31,  2003,  (iii)\nmodified the financial covenants applicable to subsequent periods, and\n(iv)  increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility.\nOn  May 15, 2003, American pledged an additional 30 (non-Section  1110\neligible) aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of April  30,\n2003   of  approximately  $450  million.   Pursuant  to  the  modified\nfinancial  covenants, American is required to maintain at  least  $1.0\nbillion  of  liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash and short-term\ninvestments,  for  the  second quarter 2003  and  beyond.   While  the\nCompany was in compliance with the covenant at June 30, 2003,  if  the\nCompany is adversely affected by the risk factors discussed in Note  2\nto  the  condensed consolidated financial statements or  elsewhere  in\nthis  Report,  it  is uncertain whether the Company will  be  able  to\nsatisfy  this  liquidity requirement through  the  expiration  of  the\nfacility  at the end of 2005. Failure to do so or obtain a  waiver  of\nthis  requirement  would result in a default under this  facility  and\nwould likely trigger defaults under a significant number of other debt\narrangements.\n\nIn  addition, the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges under the\nfacility has been decreased until the period ending December 31, 2004,\nand  the  next  test of such cash flow coverage ratio will  not  occur\nuntil  March  31, 2004.  The amendment also provided for  a  50  basis\npoint  increase in the applicable margin over London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR), which resulted in an effective interest rate (as of June\n30,  2003) of 4.73 percent.  The interest rate will be reset again  on\nSeptember  17, 2003.  At American\'s option, interest on  the  facility\ncan  be  calculated  on  one  of several different  bases.   For  most\nborrowings, American would anticipate choosing a floating  rate  based\nupon LIBOR.\n\n                                  -21-\n\n 24\nIn  April 2003, the President signed the Act, which includes aviation-\nrelated assistance provisions. The Act authorized payment of (i)  $100\nmillion  to  compensate air carriers for the direct  costs  associated\nwith  the  strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and (ii)  $2.3\nbillion  to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs  which\nwas distributed in proportion to the amounts each carrier had paid  or\ncollected in passenger security and air carrier security fees  to  the\nTransportation Security Administration as of the Act\'s enactment  (the\nSecurity  Fee  Reimbursement).   In addition,  the  Act  suspends  the\ncollection  of  the  passenger security fee from June  1,  2003  until\nOctober  1,  2003  and authorizes the extension of war-risk  insurance\nthrough August 31, 2004 (and permits further extensions until December\n31,  2004).  The Act also limits the total cash compensation  for  the\ntwo  most  highly  compensated named executive officers  in  2002  for\ncertain  airlines, including the Company, during the period  April  1,\n2003  to  April  1,  2004  to the amount of salary  received  by  such\nofficers, or their successors, in 2002.  A violation of this executive\ncompensation  provision  would  require  the  carrier  to  repay   the\ngovernment  for  the  amount of the Security  Fee  Reimbursement.  The\nCompany  does not anticipate any difficulties in complying  with  this\nlimitation  on  executive compensation and believes the likelihood  of\nrepaying   the   government  for  the  amount  of  the  Security   Fee\nReimbursement is remote. The Company\'s Security Fee Reimbursement  was\n$358 million (net of payments to independent regional affiliates)  and\nwas  recorded as a reduction to operating expenses during  the  second\nquarter  of  2003.  The Company\'s compensation for  the  direct  costs\nassociated with strengthening flight deck doors will be recorded as  a\nreduction  to  capitalized  flight  equipment  as  such  amounts   are\nreceived.\n\nThe Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related  to\nprojected   workers\'  compensation  obligations  and   various   other\nobligations of $550 million as of June 30, 2003. In the first  quarter\nof  2003,  the Company redeemed $339 million of tax-exempt bonds  that\nwere  backed  by standby letters of credit secured by restricted  cash\nand short-term investments resulting in a reduction in restricted cash\nand  short-term  investments. Of the $339 million of tax-exempt  bonds\nthat  were  redeemed,  $253 million were accounted  for  as  operating\nleases.   Payments to redeem these tax-exempt special facility revenue\nbonds  are  generally  considered prepaid facility  rentals  and  will\nreduce  future operating lease commitments. The remaining $86  million\nof  tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as debt and\nhad original maturities in 2014 through 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2003 the Company has approximately $221 million in fuel\nprepayments  and  credit card holdback deposits  classified  as  Other\ncurrent  assets and Other assets in the condensed consolidated balance\nsheet.\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  9  to the condensed  consolidated  financial\nstatements, the Company reached concessionary agreements with certain\nlessors.   The  Vendor  Agreements with these  lessors  affected  the\npayments, lease term, and other conditions of certain leases.   As  a\nresult  of  these changes to the payment and lease terms,  30  leases\nwhich  were  previously  accounted  for  as  operating  leases   were\nconverted  to  capital  leases, and one lease  which  was  previously\naccounted for as a capital lease was converted to an operating lease.\nThe   remaining   leases   did  not  change   from   their   original\nclassification.  The Company recorded the new capital leases  at  the\nfair  value of the respective assets being leased. These changes  did\nnot have a significant effect on the Company\'s condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet.\n\nIn addition, certain of the concessionary agreements provide that the\nCompany\'s obligations under the related lease revert to the  original\nterms  if certain events occur prior to December 31, 2005, including:\n(i)  an  event  of  default under the related lease (which  generally\noccurs only if a payment default occurs), (ii) an event of loss  with\nrespect  to  the related aircraft, (iii) rejection by the Company  of\nthe  lease  under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode  or (iv) the Company\'s filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7  of\nthe  Bankruptcy Code.  If any one of these events were to occur,  the\nCompany  would  be  responsible  for  approximately  $11  million  in\nadditional  lease  payments as of June 30, 2003.   This  amount  will\nincrease to $230 million prior to the expiration of the provision  on\nDecember  31,  2005.  Such amounts are being  treated  as  contingent\nrentals and will only be recognized if they become due.\n\n                               -22-\n\n 25\nAs  part of the Vendor Agreements discussed in Note 2 to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, American entered into an  agreement\nto  transfer 33 Fokker 100 aircraft (with minimal net book value as of\nJune  30, 2003) to a lender in the third quarter of 2003.  In  return,\nthe  lender  has agreed to restructure approximately $130  million  in\ndebt related to certain of these aircraft.  In addition, American will\nprovide shares of AMR common stock to the lender as discussed in  Note\n2  to  the  condensed consolidated financial statements. However,  the\nrestructured  debt  agreement contains certain provisions  that  would\nrequire  American  to repay certain amounts of the  original  debt  if\ncertain  events  occur prior to December 31, 2005, including:  (i)  an\nevent  of  default (which generally occurs only if a  payment  default\noccurs),  (ii) an event of loss with respect to the related  aircraft,\n(iii)  rejection by the Company of the lease under the  provisions  of\nChapter  11  of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or (iv) the Company\'s  filing\nfor  bankruptcy  under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The  Company\nexpects  to  recognize  a  significant  gain  as  a  result  of   this\nrestructuring, with the majority of the gain recognized in  the  third\nquarter of 2003, and the remainder recognized on December 31, 2005, if\nnone of the above events have occurred.\n\nNet  cash  provided  by operating activities in the  six-month  period\nended June 30, 2003 was $384 million, an increase of $339 million over\nthe  same  period in 2002.  Included in net cash provided by operating\nactivities  the  first six months of 2003 was the receipt  of  a  $572\nmillion  federal tax refund and the receipt of $358 million  from  the\ngovernment  under  the  Act.  Included in net  provided  by  operating\nactivities  for  the  first six months of 2002 was approximately  $658\nmillion received by the Company as a result of the utilization of  its\n2001 NOLs.  Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2003 were\n$847 million, and included the acquisition of seven Boeing 767-300ERs,\ntwo  Boeing 777-200 ERs, ten Embraer 140s and four Bombardier  CRJ-700\naircraft.  These capital expenditures were financed primarily  through\nsecured mortgage and debt agreements.\n\nDuring  the  six-month period ended June 30, 2003,  American  and  AMR\nEagle   borrowed  approximately  $641  million  under   various   debt\nagreements  which  are secured by aircraft and other  property.  These\nagreements  have effective interest rates which are fixed or  variable\nbased  on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various periods of  time\nthrough  2019.   As of June 30, 2003, the effective interest  rate  on\nthese agreements ranged up to 8.81 percent.\n\nIn  June  2003, the Company sold its interest in Worldspan, a computer\nreservations  company,  for $180 million in cash  and  a  $39  million\npromissory note, resulting in a gain of $17 million which is  included\nin Other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nAs  of  June  30,  2003, the Company had commitments  to  acquire  the\nfollowing  aircraft: two Boeing 767-300ERs, 12 Embraer  regional  jets\nand  seven  Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2003; an aggregate  of  74  Embraer\nregional jets and six Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2004 through 2006; and an\naggregate  of  47 Boeing 737-800s and nine Boeing 777-200ERs  in  2006\nthrough  2010.   Future  payments  for  all  aircraft,  including  the\nestimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate $407  million\nduring  the  remainder of 2003, $755 million in 2004, $711 million  in\n2005  and  an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion in 2006  through\n2010.  Boeing  Capital  Corporation has  agreed  to  provide  backstop\nfinancing  for  all Boeing aircraft deliveries in  2003.   In  return,\nAmerican  has  granted Boeing a security interest in  certain  advance\npayments  previously  made and in certain rights  under  the  aircraft\npurchase  agreement  between American and Boeing.   In  addition,  the\nCompany  has pre-arranged financing or backstop financing for  all  of\nits  2003 Embraer and Bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion  of\nits post 2003 deliveries.\n\nSpecial   facility   revenue  bonds  have  been  issued   by   certain\nmunicipalities  primarily to purchase equipment  and  improve  airport\nfacilities that are leased by American and accounted for as  operating\nleases.  Approximately $2.1 billion of these bonds (with total  future\npayments  of  approximately $5.2 billion as  of  June  30,  2003)  are\nguaranteed  by American, AMR, or both.  These guarantees can  only  be\ninvoked  in  the  event American defaults on the lease obligation  and\ncertain  other remedies are not available.  Approximately $740 million\nof  these  special  facility revenue bonds  contain  mandatory  tender\nprovisions  that require American to repurchase the bonds  at  various\ntimes  through 2008, including $198 million in November 2003. Although\nAmerican has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurance\nthat  these  bonds will be successfully remarketed.  Any  payments  to\nredeem  or  purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally  be\nconsidered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future  operating\nlease commitments.\n\n                                 -23-\n\n 26\nThe   following  table  summarizes  the  Company\'s  obligations   and\ncommitments as of June 30, 2003, to be paid in 2003 through 2007  (in\nmillions):\n\n\n     \nNature of commitment          2003(6)  2004     2005     2006    2007\n\nOperating lease payments\n for aircraft and facility\n obligations (1)              $715     $1,093   $1,035    $970    $947\nFirm aircraft commitments (2)  407        755      711     669     684\nFee per block hour\n commitments (3)                81        164      166     167     168\nLong-term debt (4)             311        566    1,344   1,127   1,070\nCapital lease obligations      107        321      252     252     187\nOther commitments (5)            -        158      158     158     158\n\nTotal obligations and\n commitments                $1,621     $3,057   $3,666  $3,343  $3,214\n\n        (1)    Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities -\n               which are supported by operating leases executed by American -\n               are guaranteed by AMR and American.\n        (2)    Substantially all of the 2003 commitment is supported by\n               committed financing.\n        (3)    Includes expected payments based on projected  volumes\n               rather than minimum required payments.\n        (4)    Excludes related interest amounts.\n        (5)    Includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services,\n               primarily information technology support.  Other commitments for\n               the remainder of 2003 are not significant.\n        (6)    Amounts are as of June 30, 2003.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  commitments summarized above,  the  Company  is\nrequired  to make contributions to its defined benefit pension  plans.\nThese   contributions   are  required  under   the   minimum   funding\nrequirements  of the Employee Retirement Pension Plan Income  Security\nAct (ERISA). The Company\'s 2003 minimum required pension contributions\nare  approximately  $186  million and  the  Company\'s  estimated  2004\nminimum  required  pension  contributions are  $600  million.  Due  to\nuncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating\nfuture  required  contributions, such as pension plan benefit  levels,\ninterest  rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns,  the\nCompany  is  not  able  to reasonably estimate the  amount  of  future\nrequired  contributions beyond 2004.  However, based  on  the  current\nregulatory environment and market conditions, the Company expects  its\n2005  minimum  required pension contributions to significantly  exceed\nits 2004 minimum required pension contributions.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nA  provision in the scope clause of American\'s prior contract with the\nAllied Pilots Associations (APA) limited the number of available  seat\nmiles  (ASMs)  and  block hours that could be flown  under  American\'s\nmarketing  code  (AA)  by American\'s regional  carrier  partners  when\nAmerican  pilots are on furlough (the so-called ASM cap).   To  ensure\nthat  American remained in compliance with the ASM cap,  American  and\nAmerican Eagle took several steps in 2002 to reduce the number of ASMs\nflown  by  American\'s wholly-owned commuter air carriers.  As  one  of\nthose  measures, AMR Eagle signed a letter of intent to sell Executive\nAirlines, its San Juan-based subsidiary.\n\nAnother  provision in the prior APA contract limited to 67  the  total\nnumber  of regional jets with more than 44 seats that could  be  flown\nunder  the  AA  code by American\'s regional carrier partners.  As  AMR\nEagle  continued to accept previously-ordered Bombardier  and  Embraer\nregional  jets  this cap would have been reached  in  early  2003.  To\nensure that American remained in compliance with the 67-aircraft  cap,\nAMR  Eagle  reached  an  agreement to dispose of  14  Embraer  ERJ-145\naircraft from its fleet.  Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnection\ncarrier,  agreed to acquire these aircraft.   Under the prior contract\nbetween  AA and the APA, Trans States would have had to operate  these\naircraft under its AX code, rather than the AA* code, at its St. Louis\nhub.\n\n                                  -24-\n\n 27\nThe   Labor  Agreement  with  the  APA  (one  of  the  Modified  Labor\nAgreements),  ratified in April 2003, modified the provisions  in  the\nAPA contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs  to\ngive  the Company more flexibility with its American Eagle operations.\nThe limitations on the use of regional jets were substantially reduced\nand  are  now tied to 110 percent of the size of American\'s narrowbody\naircraft  fleet.  As a consequence of these modifications,  it  is  no\nlonger  necessary to use Trans States\' AX marketing  code  on  flights\noperated by Trans States as the AmericanConnection, and AMR Eagle  has\ndiscontinued its plans to sell Executive Airlines.   In addition,  AMR\nEagle  has  revised  its agreement to dispose of  14  Embraer  ERJ-145\naircraft to include ten rather than 14 aircraft.\n\nThe   Company  carries  insurance  for  public  liability,   passenger\nliability,  property damage and all-risk coverage for  damage  to  its\naircraft.   As  a  result of the September 11, 2001  events,  aviation\ninsurers  have significantly reduced the amount of insurance  coverage\navailable  to  commercial air carriers for liability to persons  other\nthan  employees  or  passengers  for claims  resulting  from  acts  of\nterrorism,  war or similar events (war-risk coverage).   At  the  same\ntime,  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage  as\nwell  as  for  aviation insurance in general. The U.S. government  has\nprovided  commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines  until\nAugust  12,  2003  covering  losses to  employees,  passengers,  third\nparties  and  aircraft.  The Company believes this insurance  coverage\nwill  be extended beyond August 12, 2003 because the Act provides  for\nthe  insurance  to  remain in place until August  31,  2004,  and  the\nDepartment  of  Transportation has stated its intent  to  do  so.   In\naddition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy  until\nDecember  31, 2004, at his discretion. However, there is no  guarantee\nthat  it  will  be  extended. In the event  the  commercial  insurance\ncarriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available  to\nthe  Company or significantly increase the cost of aviation insurance,\nor  if  the Government fails to renew the war-risk insurance  that  it\nprovides,  the  Company\'s  operations and/or  financial  position  and\nresults of operations would be materially adversely affected.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\n\nStatements  in this report contain various forward-looking statements\nwithin  the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,  as\namended,  and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as\namended,  which  represent  the  Company\'s  expectations  or  beliefs\nconcerning  future  events.   When  used  in  this  document  and  in\ndocuments  incorporated  herein by reference,  the  words  "expects,"\n"plans,"  "anticipates,"  "believes,"  and  similar  expressions  are\nintended  to  identify  forward-looking  statements.  Forward-looking\nstatements  include,  without limitation, the Company\'s  expectations\nconcerning operations and financial conditions, including changes  in\ncapacity,  revenues, and costs, expectations as to  future  financing\nneeds,  overall  economic  conditions and plans  and  objectives  for\nfuture  operations,  the  impact on the  Company  of  the  events  of\nSeptember 11, 2001 and of its results of operations for the past  two\nyears  and the sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb  that\nimpact. Other forward-looking statements include statements which  do\nnot  relate  solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation,\nstatements which discuss the possible future effects of current known\ntrends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of\nknown  trends  or  uncertainties cannot be predicted,  guaranteed  or\nassured.   All  forward-looking statements in this report  are  based\nupon information available to the Company on the date of this report.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any\nforward-looking  statement, whether as a result of  new  information,\nfuture  events or otherwise.  Forward-looking statements are  subject\nto a number of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from our expectations. The following factors, in  addition\nto  other  possible  factors not listed, could  cause  the  Company\'s\nactual  results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-\nlooking statements:  the uncertain financial and business environment\nthe  Company faces, the struggling economy, high fuel prices and  the\navailability  of  fuel, the residual effects  of  the  war  in  Iraq,\nconflicts  in  the  Middle East, the residual  effects  of  the  SARS\noutbreak,  historically low fare levels, the competitive environment,\nuncertainties with respect to the Company\'s international operations,\nchanges  in  its  business  strategy,  actions  by  U.S.  or  foreign\ngovernment agencies, the possible occurrence of additional  terrorist\nattacks,  the inability of the Company to satisfy existing  liquidity\nrequirements  or other covenants in certain of its credit  agreements\nand  the  availability  of future financing.  Additional  information\nconcerning  these  and other factors is contained  in  the  Company\'s\nSecurities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited\nto the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the Form 10-\nQ for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.\n\n                               -25-\n\n 28\nItem 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nMarket Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions\n\nExcept  as  discussed  below, there have been no material  changes  in\nmarket risk from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the Company\'s  2002  Form\n10-K.\n\nThe  risk inherent in the Company\'s fuel related market risk sensitive\ninstruments  and positions is the potential loss arising from  adverse\nchanges in the price of fuel.  The sensitivity analysis presented does\nnot consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall\neconomic  activity, nor does it consider additional actions management\nmay  take to mitigate the Company\'s exposure to such changes.   Actual\nresults may differ.\n\nAircraft Fuel   The Company\'s earnings are affected by changes in  the\nprice  and  availability of aircraft fuel.   In  order  to  provide  a\nmeasure of control over price and supply, the Company trades and ships\nfuel  and  maintains  fuel storage facilities to  support  its  flight\noperations.  The  Company also manages the price risk  of  fuel  costs\nprimarily  by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude swap  and  option\ncontracts.  As  of June 30, 2003, the Company had hedged approximately\n29  percent  of  its  expected fuel needs for the remainder  of  2003,\napproximately 21 percent of its expected first quarter 2004 fuel needs\nand  an insignificant percentage of its expected fuel needs beyond the\nfirst  quarter  of 2004, compared to approximately 32 percent  of  its\nestimated  2003  fuel requirements, 15 percent of its  estimated  2004\nfuel  requirements, and approximately four percent  of  its  estimated\n2005 fuel requirements hedged at December 31, 2002. Beginning in March\n2003,  the  Company revised its hedging strategy and,  in  June  2003,\nterminated  substantially all of its contracts with maturities  beyond\nMarch  2004.  The  Company\'s reduced credit  rating  has  limited  its\nability  to  enter  into  certain types of fuel  hedge  contracts.   A\nfurther  deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position  may\nnegatively  affect the Company\'s ability to hedge fuel in the  future.\nFor  additional information see Note 16 to the condensed  consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nItem 4.  Controls and Procedures\n\nAn  evaluation  was  performed  under the  supervision  and  with  the\nparticipation  of  the  Company\'s  management,  including  the   Chief\nExecutive  Officer  (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer  (CFO),  of  the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\'s  disclosure\ncontrols as of June 30, 2003.  Based on that evaluation, the Company\'s\nmanagement,  including the CEO and CFO, concluded that  the  Company\'s\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective.  There have been no\nsignificant  changes in the Company\'s internal controls  or  in  other\nfactors that could significantly affect internal controls.\n\n                                   -26-\n\n 29\nPART II:  OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1.  Legal Proceedings\n\nOn  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November\n1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American\nAirlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting\nCorporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States\nDistrict  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western\nDivision  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The\nlawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to\nAmerican for violations of American\'s fare rules (by customers of  the\nagencies): (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American\nand  AMR  Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2) constitutes unjust enrichment;\nand  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations\nAct  of 1970 (RICO).  The certified class includes all travel agencies\nwho  have been or will be required to pay money to American for  debit\nmemos  for  fare rules violations from July 26, 1995 to  the  present.\nThe  plaintiffs  seek  to enjoin American from enforcing  the  pricing\nrules  in  question and to recover the amounts paid for  debit  memos,\nplus  treble damages, attorneys\' fees, and costs.  The Company intends\nto  vigorously defend the lawsuit.  Although the Company believes that\nthe  litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision could\nimpose   restrictions  on  the  Company\'s  relationships  with  travel\nagencies which could have an adverse impact on the Company.\n\nOn  May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of\nthe  Department  of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American  Airlines,\nInc.,  and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in  Wichita,\nKansas  (United  States v. AMR Corporation, et  al,  No.  99-1180-JTM,\nUnited  States District Court for the District of Kansas). The lawsuit\nalleges   that   American  unlawfully  monopolized  or  attempted   to\nmonopolize  airline  passenger service to and from  Dallas/Fort  Worth\nInternational Airport (DFW) by increasing service when new competitors\nbegan  flying  to  DFW, and by matching these new competitors\'  fares.\nThe  Department of Justice seeks to enjoin American from  engaging  in\nthe  alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on American  to\nremedy  the alleged effects of its past conduct.  On April  27,  2001,\nthe  U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas granted American\'s\nmotion for summary judgment.  On June 26, 2001, the U.S. Department of\nJustice  appealed  the  granting  of  American\'s  motion  for  summary\njudgment (United States v. AMR Corporation, et al, No. 01-3203, United\nStates  District  Court  of Appeals for the  Tenth  Circuit),  and  on\nSeptember 23, 2002, the parties presented oral arguments to  the  10th\nCircuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the summary judgment on  July\n3,  2003.  It is unknown whether the U. S. Department of Justice  will\nseek  a  review of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals\' decision by  the\nU.S.   Supreme   Court.  A  final  adverse  court  decision   imposing\nrestrictions on the Company\'s ability to respond to competitors  would\nhave an adverse impact on the Company.\n\nBetween  May  14,  1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action  lawsuits\nwere  filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR\nEagle  Holding  Corporation in the United  States  District  Court  in\nWichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state\nantitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys\' fees (King\nv. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric v. AMR\nCorp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v. AMR Corp.,  et\nal.; Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl v. AMR Corp., et al.).\nCollectively,   these   lawsuits  allege  that   American   unlawfully\nmonopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to\nand  from DFW by increasing service when new competitors began  flying\nto  DFW,  and by matching these new competitors\' fares.   Two  of  the\nsuits   (Smith  and  Wright)  also  allege  that  American  unlawfully\nmonopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to\nand from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by\noffering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on\nthe  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override\ncommissions  to  travel agents. The suits propose to  certify  several\nclasses  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who\npurchased tickets for air travel on American into or out of  DFW  from\n1995  to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed\nall  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the\nDepartment of Justice (see above description).  To date no  class  has\nbeen   certified.   The  Company  intends  to  defend  these  lawsuits\nvigorously.   One  or  more  final adverse  court  decisions  imposing\nrestrictions  on  the Company\'s ability to respond to  competitors  or\nawarding substantial money damages would have an adverse impact on the\nCompany.\n\n                               -27-\n\n 30\nOn  May  17,  2002,  the named plaintiffs in Hall, et  al.  v.  United\nAirlines, et al., pending in the United States District Court for  the\nEastern  District  of  North  Carolina,  filed  an  amended  complaint\nalleging that between 1995 and the present, American and over 15 other\ndefendant  airlines conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based\ntravel agents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The  court\ngranted  class action certification to the plaintiff on September  17,\n2002,  defining the plaintiff class as all travel agents in the United\nStates, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, who, at any\ntime   from   October  1,  1997  to  the  present,   issued   tickets,\nmiscellaneous change orders, or prepaid ticket advices for  travel  on\nany  of  the defendant airlines.  The case is stayed as to US  Airways\nand  United  Air Lines, since they filed for bankruptcy.  American  is\nvigorously defending the lawsuit.  Defendant carriers filed  a  motion\nfor  summary judgment on December 10, 2002. Trial is set to  begin  on\nFebruary  2, 2004. A final adverse court decision awarding substantial\nmoney  damages  or  placing restrictions on the  Company\'s  commission\npolicies or practices would have an adverse impact on the Company.\n\nBetween  April 3, 2003 and June 5, 2003 three lawsuits were  filed  by\ntravel  agents who have opted out of the Hall class action (above)  to\npursue  their  claims  individually against American  Airlines,  Inc.,\nother  airline  defendants, and in one case  against  certain  airline\ndefendants  and Orbitz LLC.  (Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta  Air  Lines\net. al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof  California - San Francisco (51 individual agencies), Paula  Fausky\nd/b/a  Timeless  Travel v. American Airlines, et. al,  in  the  United\nStates  District  Court  for the Northern  District  of  Ohio  Eastern\nDivision  (29 agencies) and Swope Travel et al. v. Orbitz et.  al.  in\nthe  United  States District Court for the Eastern District  of  Texas\nBeaumont  Division (6 agencies)).  Collectively, these  lawsuits  seek\ndamages  and  injunctive  relief alleging  that  the  certain  airline\ndefendants and Orbitz LLC: (i) conspired to prevent travel agents from\nacting as effective competitors in the distribution of airline tickets\nto  passengers  in  violation of Section 1 of the Sherman  Act;   (ii)\nconspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air  travel\nbetween airports in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the\nSherman  Act; and that (iii) between 1995 and the present, the airline\ndefendants  conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based  travel\nagents  in  violation  of Section 1 of the Sherman  Act.  American  is\nvigorously  defending these lawsuits. A final adverse  court  decision\nawarding  substantial  money damages or placing  restrictions  on  the\nCompany\'s distribution practices would have an adverse impact  on  the\nCompany.\n\nOn April 26, 2002, six travel agencies filed Albany Travel Co., et al.\nv.  Orbitz, LLC, et al., in the United States District Court  for  the\nCentral  District  of California against American, United  Air  Lines,\nDelta Air Lines, and Orbitz, LLC, alleging that American and the other\ndefendants:  (i)  conspired to prevent travel agents  from  acting  as\neffective  competitors  in  the distribution  of  airline  tickets  to\npassengers  in  violation  of  Section  1  of  the  Sherman  Act;  and\n(ii)  conspired to monopolize the distribution of common  carrier  air\ntravel between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2\nof the Sherman Act.  The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide\nclass of travel agents, but no class has yet been certified.  American\nis  vigorously  defending  the lawsuit.  On  November  25,  2002,  the\nDistrict Court stayed this case pending a judgment in Hall et. al.  v.\nUnited  Airlines,  et. al. (see above description).  A  final  adverse\ncourt   decision  awarding  substantial  money  damages   or   placing\nrestrictions  on the Company\'s distribution practices  would  have  an\nadverse impact on the Company.\n\nOn  April  25, 2002, a Quebec travel agency filed a motion  seeking  a\ndeclaratory  judgment  of  the  Superior  Court  in  Montreal,  Canada\n(Voyages  Montambault  (1989)  Inc.  v.  International  Air  Transport\nAssociation,  et al.), that American and the other airline  defendants\nowe  a  "fair  and  reasonable commission" to  the  agency,  and  that\nAmerican  and the other airline defendants breached alleged  contracts\nwith  the  agency by adopting policies of not paying base commissions.\nThe  motion  was  subsequently amended to  add  40  additional  travel\nagencies as petitioners.  The current defendants are the International\nAir  Transport Association, the Air Transport Association  of  Canada,\nAir  Canada,  American, America West Airlines, Delta Air Lines,  Grupo\nTACA,   Northwest   Airlines/KLM  Airlines,   United   Airlines,   and\nContinental  Airlines.  American is vigorously defending the  lawsuit.\nAlthough the Company believes that the litigation is without merit,  a\nfinal  adverse court decision granting declaratory relief could expose\nthe  Company  to  claims for substantial money damages  or  force  the\nCompany  to  pay  agency commissions, either of which  would  have  an\nadverse impact on the Company.\n\n                                -28-\n\n 31\nOn May 13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in Always Travel, et. al. v. Air\nCanada,  et.  al.,  pending  in the Federal  Court  of  Canada,  Trial\nDivision,  Montreal, filed a statement of claim alleging that  between\n1995 and the present, American, the other defendant airlines, and  the\nInternational   Air   Transport  Association   conspired   to   reduce\ncommissions  paid  to  Canada-based  travel  agents  in  violation  of\nSection  45  of  the Competition Act of Canada.  The named  plaintiffs\nseek  to  certify  a  nationwide class of travel agents.   Plaintiffs\'\nmotion  for  certification is set for hearing on  September  2,  2003.\nAmerican  is vigorously defending the lawsuit.  A final adverse  court\ndecision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on\nthe  Company\'s commission policies would have an adverse impact on the\nCompany.\n\nOn  August 14, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against American\nAirlines,  Inc.  in the United States District Court for  the  Central\nDistrict  of  California,  Western Division  (All  World  Professional\nTravel  Services,  Inc.  v.  American Airlines,  Inc.).   The  lawsuit\nalleges  that  requiring  travel  agencies  to  pay  debit  memos  for\nrefunding  tickets after September 11, 2001:  (1) breaches  the  Agent\nReporting  Agreement between American and plaintiff;  (2)  constitutes\nunjust  enrichment;  and  (3) violates the  Racketeer  Influenced  and\nCorrupt  Organizations  Act of 1970 (RICO).  The  as  yet  uncertified\nclass includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay\nmoneys  to  American for an "administrative service charge,"  "penalty\nfee," or other fee for processing refunds on behalf of passengers  who\nwere unable to use their tickets in the days immediately following the\nresumption of air carrier service after the tragedies on September 11,\n2001.   The  plaintiff  seeks to enjoin American from  collecting  the\ndebit memos and to recover the amounts paid for the debit memos,  plus\ntreble  damages, attorneys\' fees, and costs.  The Company  intends  to\nvigorously defend the lawsuit.  Although the Company believes that the\nlitigation  is  without merit, a final adverse  court  decision  could\nimpose   restrictions  on  the  Company\'s  relationships  with  travel\nagencies which could have an adverse impact on the Company.\n\nOn  August 19, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed, and on  May  7,\n2003  an  amended  complaint was filed in the United  States  District\nCourt   for   the   Southern  District  of  New  York  (Power   Travel\nInternational,  Inc.  v.  American Airlines,  Inc.,  et  al.)  against\nAmerican, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines,  and\nNorthwest  Airlines, alleging that American and the  other  defendants\nbreached  their  contracts with the agency and were unjustly  enriched\nwhen these carriers at various times reduced their base commissions to\nzero.   The  as  yet  uncertified class includes all  travel  agencies\naccredited   by  the  Airlines  Reporting  Corporation   "whose   base\ncommissions on airline tickets were unilaterally reduced to  zero  by"\nthe  defendants.  The case is stayed as to United Air Lines, since  it\nfiled  for bankruptcy.  American is vigorously defending the  lawsuit.\nAlthough the Company believes that the litigation is without merit,  a\nfinal  adverse  court decision awarding substantial money  damages  or\nforcing  the Company to pay agency commissions would have  an  adverse\nimpact on the Company.\n\nMiami-Dade   County  (the  County)  is  currently  investigating   and\nremediating   various   environmental   conditions   at   the    Miami\nInternational Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs  through\nlanding  fees  and various cost recovery methods.  American  Airlines,\nInc.  and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties\n(PRPs)  for  the contamination at MIA.  During the second  quarter  of\n2001,  the  County  filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,  including\nAmerican Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and  future\ncleanup  costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo  Services,\nInc.,  et  al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to  the  17\ndefendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were\nalso  named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination.  American\'s\nand  AMR  Eagle\'s  portion of the cleanup costs cannot  be  reasonably\nestimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of  the\nremedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that\nwill  ultimately  be  recovered  from  the  responsible  parties,  and\nuncertainties   regarding  the  environmental   agencies   that   will\nultimately  supervise the remedial activities and the nature  of  that\nsupervision.  The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.\n\n\n                                -29-\n\n 32\n                                PART II\n\nItem 6.
